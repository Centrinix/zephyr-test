### Zephyr Test Workflows for GitHub Actions

This repository contains the GitHub Actions workflows used for testing Zephyr
RTOS.

These workflows are only intended to be run inside the runners provided by the
Centrinix internal testing server, and running them in a public GitHub Actions
runner is not supported.
